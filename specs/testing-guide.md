# Progress Feature Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Feature Implementation Complete

The progress tracking feature has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### üìÅ Files Created:
- `specs/progress-feature-spec.md` - Detailed specification
- `src/types/progress.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `src/utils/progressStorage.ts` - localStorage utilities
- `src/hooks/useProgress.ts` - React hook for progress management
- `src/components/ProgressToggle.tsx` - Toggle component for command pages
- `src/components/ProgressModal.tsx` - Progress overview modal

### üîß Files Modified:
- `src/pages/CommandPage.tsx` - Added progress toggle under command title
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Added progress button and modal integration

## üß™ Manual Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Progress Toggle on Command Pages
1. **Navigate to any command page** (e.g., `/level/beginner/command/–°–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å`)
2. **Verify toggle appears** under the command title
3. **Click the toggle** - should change from "–ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –Ω–µ –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∞" to "–ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∞"
4. **Refresh the page** - toggle state should persist
5. **Toggle again** - should switch back to uncompleted state

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Toggle switches smoothly with visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Checkmark icon appears when completed
- ‚úÖ Text changes color and content
- ‚úÖ State persists across page refreshes

### Test 2: Progress Button on Home Page
1. **Navigate to home page** (`/`)
2. **Look for "üìä –ú–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å" button** below the level selection cards
3. **Click the progress button** - modal should open

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Button is visible and styled consistently
- ‚úÖ Button opens progress modal on click

### Test 3: Progress Modal Functionality
1. **Open progress modal** from home page
2. **Verify modal content:**
   - Overall progress statistics
   - Progress bars for each level
   - List of commands with completion status
3. **Mark some commands as completed** (using toggles on command pages)
4. **Return to progress modal** - should show updated progress
5. **Test "–û—á–∏—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å" button** - should clear all progress after confirmation

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Modal displays correct progress data
- ‚úÖ Progress updates in real-time
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators (checkmarks, progress bars) work correctly
- ‚úÖ Clear progress function works with confirmation

### Test 4: Data Persistence
1. **Mark several commands as completed**
2. **Close browser completely**
3. **Reopen browser and navigate to app**
4. **Check progress modal** - should show previously marked commands

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Progress data survives browser restarts
- ‚úÖ No data loss occurs

### Test 5: Edge Cases
1. **Test with localStorage disabled** (private browsing mode)
2. **Test rapid toggle clicking**
3. **Test with all commands completed**
4. **Test with no commands completed**

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ App gracefully handles localStorage unavailability
- ‚úÖ No errors with rapid interactions
- ‚úÖ Correct display for 0% and 100% progress

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

- Accessible via "üìä –ú–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å" button on home page
- Shows overall progress statistics
- Displays progress by training level with progress bars
- Lists all commands with completion status
- "Clear Progress" functionality with confirmation

### ‚úÖ Data Management
- localStorage-based persistence
- Graceful fallback to memory storage
- Version-controlled data structure
- Error handling for edge cases

### ‚úÖ Integration
- Seamless integration with existing UI
- Consistent Material-UI styling
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## üöÄ Ready for Use

The progress tracking feature is now fully functional and ready for user testing. Users can:

1. **Mark commands as learned** using toggles on command pages
2. **View their progress** through the progress modal
3. **Track completion** across all training levels
4. **Clear progress** when needed
5. **Maintain progress** across browser sessions

The implementation follows the specification requirements and maintains the app's simple, user-friendly design while adding powerful progress tracking capabilities.
